## How to Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev webgl-operate
```

## Getting Started

The canvas can be integrated into HTML5 as follows:
```
<canvas id="multiframe">
    <!-- fallback -->
    Your browser does <strong>not support</strong> the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.
</canvas>
```

This canvas can then be setup by associating the canvas element with a single-frame or multi-frame controller and attaching a renderer using JavaScript as follows:
```
ToDo
```

## Dependencies

*webgl-operate* has currently no non-dev dependencies.


## Source Structure

| directory | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `source`         | 'public' interface of webgl-operate |
| `source/assets`  | rendering assets used such as sampling patterns, masquerade presets, or meshes | 
| `source/core`    | provides all rendering, controlling, and webgl related, non specialized classes | 
| `source/kernels` | contains pre-computed sampling patterns used for, e.g., multi-frame sampling | 
| `source/shaders` | on build, shaders are packed into the dist as well (and includes are resolved) |
| `source/stages`  | specialized rendering stages |
| `source/debug`   | optional: various tools for run-time debugging |
| `source/viewer`  | optional: generic viewer overlay and controller for webgl-operate based rendering |
| `example`        | examples demonstrating webgl-operate features | 
| `test`           | tests of sources located in `sources` |


## NPM Configuration and Project Setup

This package setup distinguishes between *develop*, *deploy*, and *publish* related scripts: 

* deployment is covered by the script `deploy` and is intended to build bundles, examples, documentation, test-results etc. It is intended for non-npm deployment and triggeres a sequence of development scripts.
* publishing is covered by the script `prepublish`and is intended to be triggered automatically by `npm publish`. It is intended for npm deployment and triggers a sequence of custom as well as other develpment scripts.
* development scripts (all except `deploy` and `prepublish`) are intended for actual development of webgl-operate.

`package.json` specifies the following scripts that can be run by `npm run-script <command>`. 

| command          | description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `build`          | build and pack library with core, debug, and viewer facilities [webpack and TypeScript](https://webpack.js.org/guides/webpack-and-typescript/) |
| `build-all`      | build and pack both minified and slim (no viewer and debug) libraries |
| `example`        | build example html pages to `dist` |
| `check`          | code quality check [TSLint Rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/): `tslint.json` |
| `doc`            | build html documentation in `dist/docs` using [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) |
| `test`           | run unit tests using [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) |
| `deploy-lite`    | lite distribution deployment triggering only build and examples |
| **`deploy`**     | full distribution deployment triggering `check`, `test`, `build-all`, `doc`, and `example` |
| **`prepublish`** | copy assets and transpile sources to `lib` directory as well as `build-all` |

The above commands can be triggered directly from within a console of course (e.g., from within the Visual Studio Code terminal).

When first working on webgl-operate, use `npm install` to install dependencies.
Use `npm run-script build` to build the library and `npm run-script examples` to build the examples.
The built examples are located in the `dist` folder.


## Deployment 

For deployment adhere to the following sequence:

* first `npm update` should be run,
* second `npm deploy` should be run.


## Visual Studio Code configuration

"[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications." 
Please not that the workspace configuration `.vscode/settings.json` has automatic format on save enabled.

#### tasks

All the above scripts, namely `build, build-all, check, deploy, deploy-lite, doc, examples, examples-watch` as well as `test` can be triggered from within Visual Studio Code.
The intended workflow is to bind a key (e.g., ctrl+alt+t) to open the task selection and trigger the desired task.
The tasks are configured in `.vscode/tasks.json`.

#### launch

Two launch configurations for debugging from within Visual Studio Code are configured in `.vscode/launch.json` and requires `msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome` plugin:

* The `Launch` configuration opens the `dist/index.html` in a Chrome tab.
* The `Attach` configuration attaches to an existing Chrome tab having the `dist/index.html` opened and enables debugging from within Visual Studio Code.
